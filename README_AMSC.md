Modified version of Lohmann, N. JSON for Modern C++ (Version 3.10.5) [Computer software]. https://github.com/nlohmann

This version is for the use in the course **Advanced modelling for
scientific computing (PACS)** by Luca Formaggia, MOX, Politecnico di Milano,
Italy.

For any other use it's better referring to the original code, since
this version is not necessarily kept updated.


## Instructions ##

The `README.md` file contains more information on the original code. 

For the use in the examples of the AMSC Course you just have to launch `install_AMSC.sh`, which installs the header files in the usual directory.


## Example ##
In the folder `MyExamples` you have some extra Examples that show the
`extract()` method that has been added to simplify the usage and specify default
values directly.

Enjoy.
