Modified version of Lohmann, N. JSON for Modern C++ (Version 3.10.4) [Computer software]. https://github.com/nlohmann

This version is for the use in the course **Advanced programming for
scientific computing (PACS)** by Luca Formaggia, MOX, Politecnico di Milano,
Italy.

For any other use it's better referring to the original code, since
this version is not necessarily kept updated.


## Instructions ##

The `README.md` file contains more information on the original code. 

For the use in the examples of the PACS Course you just have to launch `install_PACS.sh`, which installs the header files in the usual directory.


Enjoy.
